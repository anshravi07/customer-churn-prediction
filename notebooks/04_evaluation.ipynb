    "\n",
    "The Random Forest model achieved a ROC-AUC score of **0.82**, indicating strong discriminatory power between churned and retained customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that missing a churned customer is costlier than false alarms, the model was trained with class balancing and evaluated using recall and ROC-AUC rather than accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This performance is suitable for downstream churn risk analysis and business decision-making."
